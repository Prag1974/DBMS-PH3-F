# How to run?

Firstly you have to download NodeJS and MYSQL.

NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en

MySQL: https://www.mysql.com

Then you should import my database dump.
When its done, please open a CLI (it could be Git Bash or Windows Default CLI)

Type "node -v" to check if node has been installed.

Select the directory with my project code.

Then type "npm i" to download essential modules.

Find db.ts file under app/libs directory. And enter the required information about database.

Make sure schema name is entered correctly.

In CLI you should be in ./ directory then type "npm dev run." And press enter. There should be a URL in CLI which you can CTRL + Left Click in VSCode or open a browser and enter that URL.

So, here is my application.
